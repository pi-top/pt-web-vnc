Description: pi-top Web VNC Tool
 Easily start and stop VNC servers and publish them over HTTP.

 This application is specifically developed to work on Raspberry Pi OS and
 derivatives, such as pi-topOS, to create VNC servers that can share whole
 displays or particular applications over http, without the need of a VNC
 client.
